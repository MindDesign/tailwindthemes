Simple responsive HTML template using the fantastic [Tailwind CSS Framework](https://tailwindcss.com/). All images are from [Pexels](https://pexels.com/).

### Motivation

Created and shared in the hope that someone will find use for it.

## Getting Started

To use the template, nothing is needed except clone the project or download the files.

### Prerequisities

For editing the template CSS, installing [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is recommended. This project contains a `package.json` that contains Tailwind, so simply install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/getting-started) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).


### Installing

When Yarn or NPM is installed, run

```
yarn install
```

or

```
npm install
```

This will install Tailwind CSS into `node_modules`.

## Usage

Changes made to `tailwind.js` or `tailwind.css` needs to be built with the following command

```
./node_modules/.bin/tailwind build tailwind.css [-c ./tailwind.js] -o ./assets/css/mdtwo.css
```

This will update `/assets/css/mdtwo.css` with your changes.
